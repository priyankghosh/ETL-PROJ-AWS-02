Thanks for the update! Since you ran:

```bash
docker compose down -v --remove-orphans
```

That command:

* ðŸ›‘ **Stopped all containers**
* ðŸ§¹ **Removed all containers**
* ðŸ’£ **Removed all named volumes**, including your `airflow_db` (which means your `airflow.db` SQLite database is now deleted)
* ðŸ‘» **Removed orphan containers**, if any

---

### âœ… Now to use Airflow again from a clean state, run these commands **in order**:

#### 1. **Navigate to the directory with your `docker-compose.yml`**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/airflow-project
```

#### 2. **Start the containers (and recreate volumes)**

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This will:

* Recreate your Airflow services (`webserver`, `scheduler`)
* Recreate the `airflow_db` volume
* Reinitialize a new `airflow.db` SQLite file (empty DB)

---

### ðŸŸ¡ Optional: Initialize the Airflow database manually (not usually needed with SQLite)

Normally, `airflow db init` is done automatically when the webserver or scheduler starts with SQLite. But to be safe, you can manually do:

```bash
docker compose run airflow-webserver airflow db init
```

> This is especially useful if you're switching to a different database backend (like PostgreSQL) in the future.

---

### 3. **Access the Airflow UI**

After the containers are up:

* Open your browser and go to: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

If the UI doesnâ€™t load, run this to view logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```

---

### Summary of Commands (Clean Restart)

```bash
cd /path/to/your/airflow-project
docker compose up -d
# optional
docker compose run airflow-webserver airflow db init
```

Let me know if you want to add users, switch to PostgreSQL, or persist your database outside the volume.
